🚀 Customer Churn Prediction | Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview

Customer churn significantly impacts revenue in subscription-based businesses. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project develops a Machine Learning classification model to predict customer churn using behavioral and account-related features. The objective is to help businesses proactively identify high-risk customers and reduce churn rates through targeted retention strategies.

🎯 Business Problem

Companies often lose customers due to:

High monthly charges

Poor service experience

Flexible month-to-month contracts

Competitive alternatives

By predicting churn in advance, businesses can:

✔ Improve customer retention
✔ Increase lifetime value (CLV)
✔ Reduce revenue loss
✔ Optimize marketing strategies
