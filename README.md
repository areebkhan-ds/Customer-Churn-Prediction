# Customer Churn Prediction | Machine Learning Project
# Overview

Customer churn significantly impacts revenue in subscription-based businesses. Retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project develops a Machine Learning classification model to predict customer churn using behavioral and account-related features. The objective is to help businesses proactively identify high-risk customers and reduce churn rates through targeted retention strategies.

# Business Problem

Companies often lose customers due to:

High monthly charges

Poor service experience

Flexible month-to-month contracts

Competitive alternatives

By predicting churn in advance, businesses can:

✔ Improve customer retention
✔ Increase lifetime value (CLV)
✔ Reduce revenue loss
✔ Optimize marketing strategies

# Key Insights

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.

Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

Longer tenure significantly reduces churn probability.

Electronic check payment method shows higher churn trends.
